This is a script that will link together a few
tools in linux to do circuit simulation. The
tools are GNU Octave, and the spice-2g6 circuit
simulator. Octave is freely available and easy
to find. Spice was distributed with RedHat-5.2.
You can get spice from RedHat or any mirror site
that has old distributions. If you have problems 
getting spice to install, try rpm --nodeps spicexxx.rpm
this worked for me on a debian box and spice is running
fine. You will also need to install the Term::ReadKey
and Term::ANSIColor modules from CPAN. Other than these
you "should" have no problems. This script is in
its infancy so there is bound to be bugs. I have used
it for the purposes that I will be using it for
and it is working well. I hope it works well for
you. Let me know.
enjoy,
